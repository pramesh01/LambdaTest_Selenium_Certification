# LambdaTest_Selenium_Certification
How to run project:
  -> just simply download the project & copy path of the POM.xml
  -> open cmd and change path as per pom.xml file exists
  -> run command:-  mvn clean test
  # all the scenarios will be executed.
  # i tried to configure the .gitpod.yml file as well but looks like it is not fully configured
  # but still i am able to run my code with following command
  > go to project root directory i.e Pom.xml file location
  > copy path & open cmd and change path of the directory to root directory
  > run command:  mvn install -DskipTests=false 
# above command is also working for me to execute my test cases.
